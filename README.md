# CSC205

This repository covers the topics that have been learned while taking the class CSC205.

CSC205 covers the following:
1. Object-Oriented design and programming
2. Elementary data structures
3. Arrays
4. Lists
5. Stacks
6. Queues
7. Binary Trees
8. Recursion
9. Searaching and Sorting Algorithms

The primary language used is Java.

Course Competencies include:
1. Describe how modern Software Engineering techniques are used in program development.
2. Implement programs that use Object-Oriented Programming techniques: classes, aggregate classes, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism.
3. Write applications that handle run-time errors by using Exception Handling techniques.
4. Write programs using basic data structures such as arrays, ArrayLists, and Vectors.
5. Implement linked lists, stacks, and queues using Object- Oriented techniques.
6. Implement Binary Search Trees and use recursive methods as part of the implementation.
7. Analyze and compare the efficiency of different searching and sorting algorithms, including algorithms that are implemented recursively.
8. Write applications that read and write text and Object files.


Required experience with the following was required:
1. Google Drive
2. GitHub
3. Discord
4. Youtube
5. Canvas
